# User Guide - MemeVault Pro

Welcome to MemeVault Pro! This guide will walk you through creating and trading meme tokens on X Layer.

## Getting Started

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

1. Visit [MemeVault Pro](https://memevaultpro.com)
2. Click "Connect OKX Wallet" (recommended) or "Connect MetaMask"
3. Approve the connection in your wallet
4. The app will automatically switch to X Layer network

### 2. Get OKB Tokens

You'll need OKB tokens for:
- Creating tokens (1 OKB per token)
- Trading fees (5% of transaction value)

**Get OKB on X Layer:**
- Use OKX exchange to bridge OKB to X Layer
- Use official X Layer bridge
- Purchase directly on X Layer DEXs

## Creating a Token

### Step 1: Fill Token Details

1. Go to the "Create Token" section
2. Enter your token details:
   - **Name**: Your token's display name (e.g., "Doge Coin")
   - **Symbol**: Short ticker symbol (e.g., "DOGE")
   - **Description**: Brief description of your token
   - **Image URL**: Link to token logo/image

### Step 2: Create Token

1. Click "Create Token (1 OKB)"
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
3. Wait for confirmation (usually 3-5 seconds)
4. Your token is now live on the bonding curve!

### Step 3: Share Your Token

- Copy the token address from the success message
- Share on social media with #MemeVaultPro
- Your token starts with 0 supply and grows with each trade

## Trading Tokens

### Understanding Bonding Curves

MemeVault Pro uses **bonding curves** for fair price discovery:
- **Price increases** as more tokens are bought
- **Early buyers** get lower prices
- **Later buyers** pay premium prices
- **Sellers** receive fair market value

### How to Buy Tokens

1. Select a token from the dropdown or enter address
2. Enter the amount of tokens to buy
3. Click "Buy"
4. Confirm transaction in wallet
5. Tokens are instantly added to your wallet

### How to Sell Tokens

1. Select your token from the dropdown
2. Enter the amount to sell
3. Click "Sell Selected Amount"
4. Confirm transaction in wallet
5. Receive OKB instantly

### Price Calculation

The price follows this formula:
```
Price = Base Price + (Supply Ã— Increment)
```

- **Base Price**: 0.0001 OKB
- **Increment**: 0.000001 OKB per token
- **Real-time updates** as supply changes

## OKB Pool System

### How It Works

Every trade contributes to the **OKB Pool**:
- **5% fee** on all buy/sell transactions
- Pool accumulates until **80 OKB threshold**
- When threshold reached: **Automatic DEX migration**

### Pool Benefits

- **Fair Launch**: No pre-allocated tokens
- **Community Driven**: Trading fees benefit all holders
- **DEX Ready**: Automatic migration to OkieSwap
- **Transparent**: Real-time pool monitoring

### Migration Process

When pool reaches 80 OKB:
1. **36 OKB** permanently locked for liquidity
2. **44 OKB** + equivalent tokens added to DEX pool
3. Token graduates to full DEX trading
4. No more bonding curve restrictions
